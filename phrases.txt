A friend in need is a friend indeed
A leopard cannot change its spots
Half a loaf is better than no bread
Make him an offer he cannot refuse
Cannot see the wood for the trees
Even at the turning of the tide
Every cloud has a silver lining
Wear your heart on your sleeve
Necessity is the mother of invention
Neither a borrower nor a lender be
Never give a sucker an even break
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
The face that launched a thousand ships
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness
